      <h1 class="header"> Major-General's Song </h1>
      
        <h2 class="header"> Gilbert and Sulivan (1879) </h2>

<p class="paragraph">I am the very model of a modern Major-General <br>
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical,<br>
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;<br>
I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical,<br>
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,<br>
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news---<br>
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.</p>

<p class="paragraph">I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;<br>
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:<br>
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>

<p class="paragraph">I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;<br>
I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,<br>
I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,<br>
In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;<br>
I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,<br>
I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!<br>
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,<br>
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,<br>
And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:<br>
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",<br>
When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,<br>
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,<br>
And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",<br>
When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,<br>
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery – <br>
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy – <br>
You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,<br>
Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;<br>
But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>
